#Program to practice simple arithmatic exercises 

Since this program's purpose is to help a german student, the GUI's language is german at this point.

In the starting frame please select the range of numbers and the arithmetic operation(s) (multiple choices possible) that you want to practice. 
You can decide if you want to practice right away ("manuell ausf√ºllen") or save / print 10 exercises for later.

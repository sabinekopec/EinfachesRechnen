#Program to practice simple arithmatic exercises 

Since this program's purpose is to help a german student, the GUI's language is german at this point.

In the starting frame please select the range of numbers and the arithmetic operation(s) (multiple choices possible) that you want to practice. 
You can decide if you want to practice right away ("direkt üben") or save / print 10 exercises for later.
In the end you can choose to include rational numbers in your practice.

Selection of "direkt üben":
After confirming your selection, you see a new window displaying the exercise. It shows two numbers, the arithmetic operation symbol, an equal sign and a text field. Please enter the missing number in the text field. You can check your entry by clicking "Lösung prüfen". Or you can have the program insert the solution into the text field ("Lösung anzeigen"). Finally you can ask for a new exercise ("Nächste Aufgabe").

Selection of "10 Übungen zum Speichern":
After confirming you see a new window with the generated 10 exercises. You can either save them to a txt file (separate dialog) or print them.
